Overview
--------

Among the many deliberate fraudelent acts occuring frequently as means of securing unfair or unlawful gains, fake bills and advertising scams are unfortunetly common. CIRCL is often contacted by victims of such scams, and would like to issue a clear warning related to such frauds as false billing, fake invoicing or related fake advertising.

This TR document describes the nature of the scams and provides hints on how to react.

Details on the scam
----------------------------

Businesses, either big or small, often receive suspicious letters or unsolicited email messages. Among those, fake invoices or advertising frauds are fairly common.

1. **Offers looking like bills** - 
These are offers crafted to look like invoices or bills, requesting payment for goods or services that never were received. CIRCL insists uppon the fact that all fine prints should be read on any invoices, suspectively fake or not, as most of the time this will identify the true nature of these scams. An example of such scam is reproduced hereafter. Since this is not a proper bill, no further action is required appart from signaling the fraudulent sending to approapriate authorities. Creating such documents does constitute a fraudulent act.

2. **Fake invoices** - 
Such invoices include no fine print, but simply demand payment for goods or services that you never ordered or never received. Ask for written proof of the original order. The sender must be able to present evidence of your alleged purchase.

3. **Advertising fraud** - 
Unsolicited email messages offering advertising, directory entries or other services. Remember, you’re under no obligation to reply. Again, the purpose of the message is fraudulent, in the sense that victimes nmost often believe that the recieved mail does not constitute a commercial offer. Most of the time, the true nature of the document is revealed in fine prints. Once you’ve signed and returned the offer, you might end up in a deal that is binding.
