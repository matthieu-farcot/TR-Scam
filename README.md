Offers looking like bills
These are offers crafted to look like invoices or bills, requesting payment for goods or services you never received. Always read the fine print on any suspected fake invoice - this will identify the true nature of these scams. No further action is required.

2. Fake invoices
These invoices include no fine print, but simply demand payment for goods or services that you never ordered or never received. Ask for written proof of the original order. The sender must be able to present evidence of your alleged purchase.

3. Advertising fraud
Unsolicited email messages offering advertising, directory entries or other services. Remember, you’re under no obligation to reply. Once you’ve signed and returned the offer, you’ve struck a deal that is binding.
