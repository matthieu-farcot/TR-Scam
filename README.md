Overview
--------

There have been deliberate fraudelent acts occuring extremely frequently in Luxembourg as means of securing unfair or unlawful gains. As CIRCL is often contacted by victims of such scams, we would like to issue a clear warning of frauds such as false billing, fake invoicing or related fake advertising.

Businesses, either big or small, often receive suspicious letters or unsolicited email messages that can be grouped into three categories:

1. Offers looking like bills
These are offers crafted to look like invoices or bills, requesting payment for goods or services you never received. Always read the fine print on any suspected fake invoice - this will identify the true nature of these scams. No further action is required.

2. Fake invoices
These invoices include no fine print, but simply demand payment for goods or services that you never ordered or never received. Ask for written proof of the original order. The sender must be able to present evidence of your alleged purchase.

3. Advertising fraud
Unsolicited email messages offering advertising, directory entries or other services. Remember, you’re under no obligation to reply. Once you’ve signed and returned the offer, you’ve struck a deal that is binding.

Details on the scam

Here is an example list with fraud letters received by trademark holders from third parties recorded by Benelux Office for Intellectual Property (BOIP). The recipients of these letters are often under the impression that they originate from BOIP, EU IPO, WIPO or some other official agency:
